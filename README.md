# docker-configs

A home for my Docker configs, scripts, and anything else I need to remember. This is meant for personal use, but if you happen to also be interested in using **Docker on WSL** (with Windows 11), then this may be a helpful resource.

## Contents

1. [Setting Up WSL](./wsl-setup.md): installing WSL2, setting up an SSH server, forwarding ports to the host machine, and installing `docker` and `docker-compose`
2. [Setting Up NGINX](./nginx-setup.md): installing `nginx-proxy` with Docker Compose
